# Data Science - Matplotlib, Pandas, and NumPy Practice

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook where I practiced data exploration and visualization using **Python**, **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

The notebook includes:

### 🔹 Data Loading & Exploration
- Reading datasets with Pandas
- Inspecting dataset structure using `.info()`, `.head()`, `.describe()`
- Understanding data types and memory usage  
- Basic NumPy operations during data handling

### 🔹 Data Visualization
- Creating line plots, bar plots, histograms, and scatter plots using Matplotlib
- Styling plots with labels, titles, and colors
- Using Seaborn for pair plots and distribution visualizations  
- Visualizing relationships between dataset features

### 🔹 Purpose of This Notebook
This notebook is part of my learning process in:
- Python programming  
- Data analysis  
- Data visualization  
- Understanding ML-ready datasets  

I will continue improving this notebook and adding more examples as I learn more about data science.
